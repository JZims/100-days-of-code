# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Feb 23, 2021 

Once more, starting from scratch with a new curriculum and a clearer picture ahead.

**Today's Progress**: Pushed through a lot of reviewed basics in HTML. Became more familiar with using CLI, Bash and Git. 


### Day 2: Feb 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished up Flatiron's HTML prework phase. Coded a clone of an album cover and a basic tourism ad. Did bonus work on both which helped me recall some tricks in CSS. This will be good prep for the modules to come. Back to CSS tomorrow.


### Day 3: Feb 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: CSS review day for Flatiron School prework. Lots of practice with selectors, syntax, values and other basics. Strolled through most of the material, but reinforcement is always nice. 


### Days 4 and 5: Feb 27/28, 2021

CSS: Labs focused on specificity and the hierarchy of selectors. Overriding declarations with broader statements.

JS: Lots of basics to review. Data types, strict and loose operators, variable types, expressions using interpolation.

### Days 6 and 7: Mar 1/2, 2021

JS - Basic functions. Passing arguments with Functions. Loops. Pretty much every basic JS feature outside of data structures, which is tomorrow's assignment.

### Days 8, 9, and 10: Mar 3/4/5, 2021
JS - Loops, Arrays and Objects. Hanging around these for a while to let them really sink in. Lots of practice problems and confused-looking REPLs.
