# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1. 2021 

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Brushed up on Web Design (HTML and CSS) basics via The Odin Project.

**Thoughts** Loooong way to go. I need to find a project to add onto each day. It's good to first have a handle on the basics.
